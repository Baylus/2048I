# Deep Q-Learning Networks

So, this will be pretty fun to do, as its a much more complicated learning algorithm for neural networks.
NEAT is alright, but can't optimize this problem quite as good as DQN, from what I have read.
I believe that its largely due to the size of the state.

I will try to make sure that I can use both NEAT and DQN, depending on parameters.


#### Parallelize

Interesting paper on making parallel training happen. Honestly seems pretty simple to add, but I am going to start with serial, for obvious reasons.
