"""Class to create and train DQN networks


There will be several important areas that should be taken into consideration when
designing this. Mainly around the parallelizing this solution. The main aspects that
need to be considered are:
    The DQN agents will need to have a parallel

    
From the paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04296
It is claiming that the "Parameter Server" is the only one that is parallel, and
the Learner and Actor should be singular instances
